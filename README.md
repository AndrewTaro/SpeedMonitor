This modification displays the current speed of ships.
The speed of the locked-on target is always visible. However, you can press the Alt key to show the others' speed, including allies!

# Install
1. Download a zip.
2. Unzip the archive and you should get `PnFMods` folders, and `PnFModsLoader.py`.
3. Move them to `(wows)/bin/(latest_number)/res_mods/`. So the path will look like `res_mods/PnFModsLoader.py`, etc.
4. Done!
